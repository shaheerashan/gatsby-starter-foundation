***WHAT IS SASS AND WHY SHOULD YOU USE IT?***

Sass is short for "Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets"

CSS can be fun and all but nowadays stylesheets are getting harder to maintain. That is where Sass comes in, a preprocessor that has features and great stuff that can make coding CSS fun again! Most notable features are variables, extends, and mixins. One of the few great things you can do with Sass is to be able to change a value in one place and the entire stylesheet would follow automatically. Basically being able to write stylesheets faster and easily with more flexibility. Trust me once you get used to Sass it feels like its a natural extension of CSS. The ability to use variables in Sass is a great benefit since variables allow you to store information , you can reuse that as many times as you want throughout your SASS files. For example if you wanted to make multiple same color website buttons or icons. It would be a hassle to repeat this code over and over again. Again with Sass you can store this as a variable and use them whenever you need as shown in the example below.

Now with this variables created you can add color and your fonts to as many buttons as you want, like this:

This is only one of the benefits of using Sass but I'm sure you get the just of things. A very powerful tool that once you master it your files will be a lot more organized and easy to navigate.



***SASS MISCONCEPTIONS***

First thing first is that you do not need to be an advanced command-line nerd. People always hear that you must be some rocket scientist to work the command-line. The truth is you really only need a single command to get things going for Sass. If you are afraid of the command-line please don't let it stop you from using Sass. Another thing, I'm not sure why people have the belief that they need to change the way they write CSS. All Sass does is make your life easier. Don't think that Sass will take away your bloated, inefficient stylesheets. Organization and good practice still applies in Sass. It can also increase your bad habits if not too careful. However, Sass can be a huge help when its comes to creating wonderful websites. 



***SASS RULES***

A great rule to go by when using sass is that you need to keep the order of rules. Another team member or developer can read your code, understand it well, and not have to navigate through finding their way. Nesting with Sass makes life a lot easier. Instead of repeating the same selectors again and again, you only need to write one style rule inside another. Leave the rest to Sass to combine the outer rule's selector with the inner rule's. Sass nested rules are also really great. You can nest CSS selectors just like in HTML. Which makes it look much cleaner and nicer. A good rule of thumb is to avoid using ID's. They can cause
