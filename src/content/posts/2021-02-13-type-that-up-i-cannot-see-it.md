**What is typography?**

You may be wondering what in the world is typography? Do not be alarmed its very simple and easy to grasp. Typography is more about usability. Its about creating a more user-friendly experience for someone looking at your site. Whether it is about being able to read the text, amplifying your message, or making the user overcome some type of emotion. Now, emotion, is a huge topic that can grasp a viewer if your text is conveyed properly. Different people will feel different emotions when your text is read by a user. Making sure your letters amplify whatever it is you are trying to show in your website whether it is a brand or just sheer knowledge is a big deal. Typography deals with proportions and spacing along with fonts, color, and much more! It can have a huge effect on user experience and your businessâ€™s reputation. So, making sure your typography is spot on will help us with usability, readability, and help us have an aesthetic appeal to our website. 

**Understanding Typography and its Properties.**

Font and text. These are the two main groups or properties that control your typography style. Inside the font group you have your general font characteristics such as, font-style and font-weight. Whether you want your font to have an oblique style or a normal style. Weight will be responsible for whether you want your font bold or light. Now the text CSS property group deals with words, spaces, paragraphs, and characters. For example, text-indent property does what the property says which is indent the first line of a text block and letter-spacing property deals with the spaces between the blocks. Do not get me wrong here, there are many other CSS properties that can affect web typography other than font and text. For example, the color property is a huge deal when it comes to giving your text some color to make it stand out off the background color. Now it is up to you how you style you website but keep in mind nobody wants a site that has unreadable text.
